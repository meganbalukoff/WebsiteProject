Constance Balukoff began drawing at an early age and always dreamed of being an art teacher. She grew up on a small dairy farm in Pennsylvania and developed a love for nature and animals, which later became subjects of her artwork. After high school, she joined the military and traveled to new and exciting places. While living in South Dakota, she decided to obtain her Bachelor’s degree in Elementary Education with an Art minor from Black Hills State University. After moving to Frederick, Maryland with her husband and three children Constance followed her dream of becoming an art teacher. She has taught in West Virginia for ten years and still continues to do watercolor, acrylic and oil on her own. Constance will be obtaining her Master’s degree in Humanities. Constance is a self taught artist and only recently took a few classes in watercolor. She loves that the medium is always challenging to work with and never tires of trying something new with watercolor.
